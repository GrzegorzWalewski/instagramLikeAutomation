Instagram Auto liker, with account switcher 2023


## Notice
I made this code for my personal purposes. I know there are loads of other scripts like that, but I had my preferences.
1. Script has to change accounts - I have many accounts which i want to boost a little
2. I didn't wanted to follow/comment, because I don't find those methods effective. Follows just make your profile look bad when You follow more people then You are followed by. When it comes to comments - everyone that used any hashtag on instagram knows how those bots are annoying - we don't want that. And who doesn't love likes?

## FAQ
1. Why only 300 likes per day per account?
 First things first - its configurable, and you can change it to whatever number you want. Second over the internet there are diffrent opinions about daily likes limit - some say it's 300, some that it can be even 1000 likes per day. From my experience, Instagram start to notice things when You reach about 650 likes. It may be safe to go for 600, and dont get shadow ban, but I dont want to risk it ;)
2. Why there is set limit of max likes under photo over which we just skip it?
You won't be noticed if you are one of a 1k, not talking about higher values.

## TO DO
1. If possible (and won't end in performance issues) show message from **3.** as DOM element, and refresh page on the specified time
2. Code clean-up
